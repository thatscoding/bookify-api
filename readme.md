#### Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your system:

#### Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can check the installation by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal.

### Clone the Repository
#### Start by cloning the application repository to your local machine. You can use Git to do this:


```
git clone https://github.com/thatscoding/bookify-api.git
```

### Install Dependencies
#### Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd bookify-api
```

### Install the project's dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```


### Start the Application
#### You can now start the Node.js application locally by running:

```
npm start
```

#### This command will start the application, and it will be accessible locally at a specific address (usually http://localhost:3000). Open a web browser and navigate to this address to interact with the application.
